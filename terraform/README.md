## GETTINGS STARTED

**Terraform** is an **open-source Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool** created by **HashiCorp**. It allows you to **define and provision infrastructure resources** across **multiple cloud providers and on-premises** environments using a **declarative configuration language** called **HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL)**.

## Keys Features of Terraform

1. **Multi-Cloud Support**: Terraform supports a wide range of cloud providers, including AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, and many others, making it easier to manage infrastructure across different platforms.

2. **Declarative Syntax**: Terraform uses a declarative syntax to define desired infrastructure state, making it easier to manage and maintain infrastructure configurations.

3. **Resource Dependency Management**: Terraform automatically manages resource dependencies, ensuring that resources are created, updated, or deleted in the correct order.

4. **State Management**: Terraform maintains a state file that represents the current state of your infrastructure, allowing you to track changes and apply updates consistently.

5. **Idempotent Operations**: Terraform applies changes to resources in an idempotent way, ensuring that the desired state is achieved without disrupting existing resources unnecessarily.
