    "\n",
    "YAML, which stands for \"YAML Ain't Markup Language\" (a recursive acronym), is a human-friendly data serialization standard. It's designed to be easily readable by humans while also being easy for machines to parse. In this tutorial, we'll explore the core concepts of YAML."

    "## What is YAML?\n",
    "\n",
    "YAML is a data serialization language that allows you to store and transmit data in a format that's both human-readable and machine-parsable. It's often used for configuration files, data exchange between languages with different data structures, and in applications where data is being stored or transmitted.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key features of YAML include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Human-readable format\n",
    "- Support for complex data structures\n",
    "- Ability to reference other parts of the document\n",
    "- Language-independent"

    "## Basic Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "YAML uses indentation with spaces to denote structure. It's important to note that YAML does not allow tabs for indentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key-Value Pairs\n",
    "\n",
    "The most basic YAML structure is a key-value pair:\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "key: value\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "name: John Doe\n",
    "age: 30\n",
    "city: New York\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lists\n",
    "\n",
    "Lists in YAML are denoted by a dash (-) followed by a space:\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "fruits:\n",
    "  - apple\n",
    "  - banana\n",
    "  - cherry\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Nested Structures\n",
    "\n",
    "You can nest structures to create more complex data:\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "person:\n",
    "  name: Jane Smith\n",
    "  age: 28\n",
    "  address:\n",
    "    street: 123 Main St\n",
    "    city: Boston\n",
    "    country: USA\n",
    "  hobbies:\n",
    "    - reading\n",

    "## Data Types\n",
    "\n",
    "YAML supports several data types:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Strings\n",
    "\n",
    "Strings don't usually need quotes:\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "name: John Doe\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "But you can use quotes for strings with special characters:\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "message: \"Hello, World!\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "YAML automatically recognizes integers and floating-point numbers:\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "integer: 42\n",
    "float: 3.14159\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Booleans\n",
    "\n",
    "Boolean values can be represented in various ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "true_value: true\n",
    "false_value: false\n",
    "yes_value: yes\n",
    "no_value: no\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Null\n",
    "\n",
    "Null values can be represented as:\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "null_value: null\n",
    "also_null: ~\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Multi-line Strings\n",
    "\n",
    "YAML provides two ways to write multi-line strings:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Literal Block Scalar (|)\n",
    "\n",
    "Preserves line breaks:\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "description: |\n",
    "  This is a long description\n",
    "  that spans multiple lines.\n",
    "  Line breaks are preserved.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Folded Block Scalar (>)\n",
    "\n",
    "Folds line breaks into spaces:\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "description: >\n",
    "  This is another long description\n",
    "  that spans multiple lines.\n",
    "  Line breaks are folded into spaces.\n",
