    "# YAML Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language) is a human-friendly data serialization standard. While YAML is relatively easy to read and write, following best practices can greatly improve the quality, maintainability, and usability of your YAML files. This tutorial will cover key best practices for working with YAML."

    "## Indentation and Readability\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use Consistent Indentation\n",
    "\n",
    "YAML relies on indentation to denote structure. Always use spaces for indentation, never tabs. The most common practice is to use 2 spaces for each level of indentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "parent:\n",
    "  child1: value\n",
    "  child2:\n",
    "    grandchild: value\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Align Values for Readability\n",
    "\n",
    "When you have multiple key-value pairs, consider aligning the values for better readability:\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "name:     John Doe\n",
    "age:      30\n",
    "location: New York\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use Line Breaks for Long Values\n",
    "\n",
    "For long values, use YAML's block scalar styles (| or >) to improve readability:\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "description: |\n",
    "  This is a long description\n",
    "  that spans multiple lines.\n",
    "  Each line break is preserved.\n",
    "\n",
    "folded_text: >\n",
    "  This is a long text\n",
    "  that will be folded\n",
    "  into a single line.\n",

    "## Naming Conventions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use Descriptive Keys\n",
    "\n",
    "Choose clear, descriptive names for your keys. Avoid abbreviations unless they're widely understood.\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "# Good\n",
    "user_name: John Doe\n",
    "date_of_birth: 1990-01-01\n",

    "# Avoid\n",
    "un: John Doe\n",
    "dob: 1990-01-01\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Be Consistent with Key Naming\n",
    "\n",
    "Stick to a consistent naming convention throughout your YAML files. Common conventions include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- snake_case\n",
    "- camelCase\n",
    "- kebab-case\n",
    "\n",
    "Choose one and use it consistently:\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "user_name: John Doe\n",
    "date_of_birth: 1990-01-01\n",

    "### Use Appropriate Data Types\n",

    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "string_value: \"42\"\n",

    "float_value: 3.14\n",

    "### Use ISO 8601 for Dates and Times\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with dates and times, use the ISO 8601 format:\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "date: 2023-04-22\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use Quotation Marks When Necessary\n",
    "\n",
    "Use quotes for strings that contain special characters or could be misinterpreted:\n",

    "message: \"Hello, World!\"\n",
