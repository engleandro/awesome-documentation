## GETTING STARTED

TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds optional static typing to the language. It was developed and is maintained by Microsoft. TypeScript code is eventually transpiled to plain JavaScript, which can run in any JavaScript environment (browsers, Node.js, etc.).

## Key features:

- **Static Typing**: TypeScript's static typing system catches type-related errors during development, before the code is executed. This helps to prevent runtime errors and improves code quality.
- **Tooling Support**: TypeScript provides better tooling support than plain JavaScript, with features like code completion, refactoring, and inline documentation.
- **Scalability**: As projects grow in size and complexity, TypeScript's static typing and tooling support make it easier to maintain and refactor code.
- **Future JavaScript Features**: TypeScript supports modern and future JavaScript features, allowing developers to use the latest language features while still targeting older runtime environments.
- **Advanced Object Oriented Programming**: Typescript has advanced OOP features.
