    "1. Check Container Logs: Use `docker logs` to view container output.\n",

    "\n",
    "3. Check Resource Usage: Use `docker stats` to monitor resource consumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Interactive Shell: Use `docker exec` to get an interactive shell in the container for debugging.\n",

    "5. Check Container Health: If implemented, use `docker inspect --format='{{.State.Health.Status}}' CONTAINER` to check the health status.\n",
