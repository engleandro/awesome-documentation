    "\n",
    "1. Use Named Volumes: Named volumes are easier to manage and back up than anonymous volumes.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Avoid Storing Data in Containers: Always use volumes or bind mounts for persistent data.\n",

    "\n",
    "5. Regularly Backup Volumes: Implement a backup strategy for your important data volumes.\n",
