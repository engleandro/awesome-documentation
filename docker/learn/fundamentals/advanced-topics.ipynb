    "### Network Drivers\n",
    "\n",
    "Docker supports several network drivers, each serving different use cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Bridge**: The default network driver. It's suitable for standalone containers that need to communicate.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Host**: Removes network isolation between the container and the Docker host, using the host's networking directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Overlay**: Enables communication between containers across multiple Docker daemon hosts, crucial for Docker Swarm services.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Macvlan**: Allows you to assign a MAC address to a container, making it appear as a physical device on your network.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **None**: Disables all networking for a container.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of creating a custom bridge network:\n",
