## GETTINGS STARTED

**Docker** is a set of platform as a service products that use OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers. The service has both free and premium tiers. The software that hosts the containers is called Docker Engine

**Docker-Compose**  is a tool for running multi-container applications on Docker defined using the Compose file format. A Compose file is used to define how one or more containers that make up your application are configured. Once you have a Compose file, you can create and start your application with a single command: `docker compose up`.

**Podman** and **Packer** are alternatives to Docker. **Docker Swarm** and **Kubernetes** are alternatives to Docker-Compose.
