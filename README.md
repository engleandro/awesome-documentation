# AWESOME DOCUMENTATION

This is a general-purpose documentation collection to support software, data, and AI solution development.

## GETTING STARTED

```Every software has customers: owners, mainteners and end-users. Make them (and you in the future too) happy!```

Documentation is any communicable material that is used to describe, explain and instruct about a system or procedure: components, assembly, installation, maintenance and use.

A good documentation is the key to success. We recommend the Kanban Principles:

`Control service delivery through (clear and concise) policies (and let this easy to access with the process or product ideally)`

It helps:
* the owners to achieve their goals,
* the mainteners to understand/keep the technical solution,
* the end-users to understand/employ the product.

### BEST PRACTICES

The best practices on documentation development and management:
1. Standize the processes, artefacts and tools.
2. To document is to communicate. Communication is an empathy act: be clear, direct, concise, consistent and context-oriented.
3. It is a living artefact, it must be updated and maintained.
4. It is a team responsability, not only the technical writers.
5. It is a key part of the product, it must be treated as a first importance.
6. It must be integrated into the development/product life cycle.
7. Quality assurance process requires good standarization (DEFINE/STANDARIZE > MEASURE > CONTROL > MANAGE > CHECK/ACT).
8. On user experience, information and support are keys to the user's success.

### ORGANIZATION

This general documentation is organized per each technology or technique in the following sections:
* Folder `docs`: contains the general documentations.
* Folder `learn`: contains the learning resources.
* Folder `artefacts`: contains the files and templates artefacts.
* Folder `tools`: contains the tools and utilities.
