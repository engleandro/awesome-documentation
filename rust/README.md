## GETTING STARTED

`Rust` is a systems `programming language that focuses on safety, performance, and concurrency`. It was designed by Mozilla Research and has been under active development since 2010. Rust aims to provide the `performance and low-level control` of languages like C and C++, while also offering `modern features like memory safety and concurrency primitives`.

`Rust is a statically-typed,and compiled language`, which means you'll need to explicitly declare variable types and compile your code before running it.
