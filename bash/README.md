## GETTING STARTED

Bash, short for `Bourne Again Shell`, is a powerful scripting language commonly used on Unix-like operating systems.

Bash is a scripting language, so it is a programming language with limitations:
- Object-Oriented Programming is not supported natively
- There are no external libraries, only external applications such as curl
- Variables Typing is not supported, and all values are evaluated as strings. However, it is possible to use numbers by using specific commands.
- Bash's Associative array like Python's dict or JavaScript's Object is supported from version Bash v4.4
- There is no clear conventions.

Bash has features with traditional shells:
* Built-in help system
* Pipeline
* Aliases

Bash are multi-platform: it runs on Linux and MacOS.

Bash applications:
* `Operational System Tool`: Command-line that accepts parameters as and returns strings.
* `Cloud Management`: To manage cloud resources.
* `CI/CD operations`: It can also be used as part of a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment pipeline.
* `Automate Tasks`: to automate almost any task.
* `Server Remote Control`: Access and manage computer servers remotely.
